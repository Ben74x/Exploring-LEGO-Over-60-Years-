# Exploring-LEGO-Over-60-Years-
A Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, we get to explore the Rebrickable database. We use only two datasets in this project (colors dataset and sets).
